# KHET-E

## Inspiration
According to the UN, Nearly 1/2 of all fruit & vegetables produced globally are wasted each year. With decreasing energy and resources across the planet, **Khet-E** was made to promote better yield among farmers and better health among malnourished people and animals. Also, we know that it might be difficult for farmers to use websites, we have integrated the functionalities of this website in the form of a WhatsApp Bot as well in order to reach a greater target audience.
## What the Card Does
	The card for Augmented Reality-
  When the AR card is scanned, the user is directed to any one of the of four symbols that represent valued services:
	The webpage of Khet E.
	Crop Recommendation, Fertilizer Recommendation, and Disease Prediction are all included in this module.
	The bot for WhatsApp.
	The locust tracker is a map that shows where the locusts are.

Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies in Artificial intelligence that provides the ability to learn, infer, recorrect, and relearn from the experience gained. The robustness of Machine learning and Deep learning can be highly utilized in any domain especially for agriculture related production system. The accuracy and the strength of these algorithms helps the farmers to take appropriate decisions and supportive actions. 
The work has concentrated on vital part of the agriculture that has a drastic impact on farming and farmers. This paper presents a detailed explanation on five categories. They are :

## (a) crop yield prediction to increase the nourishment of the crops using Machine learning algorithm that checks the nutrients of the crops, soil fertility,provides suggestions to grow crops depending on the geographic location and the amount of rainfall received,

## (b) fertilizer recommendation with respect to the species and crop recommendation,

## (c) disease prediction in crops and livestock

## (d) Locust attack prediction. 
This function is incredibly useful and beneficial to farmers since it records the locusts' movements and notifies and directs them in the direction in which they are going, allowing farmers to securely maintain track of their harvests.

## (e) and to have a B2C model sales and purchase support.

Application of artificial intelligence in farming and farm management provides enriched experience and recommendations to the farmers that helps them to take appropriate actions without wasting time, resources and energy.



## How we built it

✅ Website is built using a html, css, python, flask, streamlit and machine learning models.  

✅ Built crop and fertilizer prediction model using random forest classifier and xgboost.  

✅ Built disease prediction model using image segmentation using resnet.  

✅ Integrated a Google Map for the nearest nursery.  

✅ The WhatsApp Bot is built using Twilio and python and the solutions are provided using all the models developed for the website.  

✅ The B2C section was build using MERN stack.

✅ The locust prediction was build using different Machine learning models such as logistic regression,XGBTree,K-nearest neighbour,Log-Linear model.

✅ The Augmented Reality was build using Unity and Vuforia.
